# Sprockets_BlackJack

Come play blackjack with Sprocket!! Dont worry no counting necessary. The app will count for you. 

This was a project built with javascript. I wanted to build something a little more complex than an calculator
to practice my logic and reasoning. This was a fun little challenge. I hope you enjoy it. If I were to spend more time I 
would have added a bark sound. You can see it in the files and added to the html but I ran out of time to make it 
function on each click. If I find the time I will impliment a happy bark when Sprocket wins and a sad whiney bark when
the player wins.
